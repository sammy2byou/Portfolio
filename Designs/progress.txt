Status:
I'm about 50% done total.
I have the design concept done each page and about 80% of the content itself gathered. 
At the time of writing this, I have the navigation 90% complete (final header image not complete), the contact me page 90% complete (text is currently a place holder text), the site map page is 90% complete (links work, design is questionable), and the other pages I still have to code the designs.
